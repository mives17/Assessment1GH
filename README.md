# GEOG5990 Assessment

# Contents

# in.txt
This is raster data arranged in a grid which is read by the code

# BasicAss1.py 
This is a basic agent-based model which shows agent movement around an environment. It should be run with in.txt open and the output is expected as an animation. 

# Ass1.py
This is the main class that is run in the more advanced agent-based model. Again, it shows agents moving around the environment, but this time they eat the environment and interact with each other. Again, the output is expected as an animation. 

# agentframework.py
This is the agent class which runs alongside Ass1.py
