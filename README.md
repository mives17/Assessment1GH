# BasicAss1.py 
this is a basic agent-based model which shows agent movement around an environment. It should be run with in.txt open and outputs an animation

# Ass1.py
this is the main class that is run in the more advanced agent-based model. Again, it shows agents moving around the environment, but this time they eat the environment and interact with each other. Again, the output is in the form of an animation

# agentframework.py
this is the agent class which runs alongside Ass1.py
